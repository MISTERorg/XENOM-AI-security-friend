# XENOM-AI-security-friend
Introducing XENOM: AI security Assistant that Secures Your World  Combines offline and online capabilities, learns from habits and behaviors, and adapts to unique needs. Prioritizes security with two-level authentication and encryption, and is constantly tested with top penetration testing tools.
FEATURES

1) INTERACTION:
- This is not just a AI assistant, its a both online (VOSK model AND PYTTSX3 ) and offline (GPT-4) AI assistant which can be
your advisor, friend and guardian because each instance of it can behave differently since
it learns from the person using it and reacts according to it's primary user's habits.
- It is hardware compatible so it can control drones,CCTV, sensors to name a few to break
the gap between man and machine.
(we intend to give it a face when it will be fully functional as psychologically speaking
 with familiar faces can bring comfort and an affect of safety)

2) Two-level authentication and SECURITY:
- The first level involves using the normal authentication procedure which involves asking
for email and password the biometric(both/either facial and finger prints)
- a technology called VAULT is used between the UI and database such trying to penetrate the
the hacker will instead see the vault instead
- the data inputer is encrypted twice using two different and strong and different encryption
technics

3) HACKING:
- it is build with top automated penetration testing tools to constantly try to break your
system trying to identify its weakness.
-email bridged testing tools,wireless testing, automated honey pots,...to name few
for reasons, we prefer ENCAPSULATING this part as different projects and resources has
been combined (not built from scratch)

HARDWARE (optional)
-Raspberry pi 3 or 4 as brain
-Aura wifi adaptor for wireless reception
-CCTV as eyes
- any audio output for mouth
- user may decide on the mic reception hardware depending on needs
- bad key or arduino pico for physical injection
(additional hardware may incur as project evolve)

SOFTWARE/PACKAGES
- We will automate all the installs packages but see installs file to see manual installs
- a Linux based system preferably kali or any Debian
- anaconda as the project is not coded on pure python

DEMO
- a simple offline interaction with housing lights has been made at but if you request more
advanced demos reach out through the comments
